# -- Definition of which packages should be analysed

# A CRAN-task-view style document that includes a range of package-development
# tools
task_view_url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/PackageDevelopment/master/PackageDevelopment.ctv

# Which packages are found on CRAN and in the task-view file, but should not be
# analysed here:
#
# {logging} - The github repo for {logging} does not conform to standard R
# package structure, and causes dupree to fail
#
# {R.oo} - The ./R/ directory of {R.oo} contains a filename with a comman in it
# "020.makeObjectFinalizer,private.R". This causes {cloc}::cloc_by_file to fail
# (because the cloc-results are read in as .csv format)
#
# {rscala} - The R package was not at the top-level of the repo (sim to
# {logging}) but had an R/ directory at the top-level, so {dupree} did not fail
drop: ["logging", "R.oo", "rscala"]
